# CPU Scheduling Algorithms in C++
This project implements four different CPU scheduling algorithms in C++: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling. The code calculates and compares the average waiting time for each algorithm and determines the most efficient algorithm based on the minimum average waiting time.

# Description
The program takes the number of processes and their respective arrival times, burst times, and priorities as input from the user. It then applies the four scheduling algorithms to the processes and computes the waiting time and turnaround time for each process under each algorithm. Finally, it compares the average waiting times of the algorithms and outputs the most efficient algorithm.
