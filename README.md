# CPU Scheduling Algorithms in C++
This project implements four different CPU scheduling algorithms in C++: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling. The code calculates and compares the average waiting time for each algorithm and determines the most efficient algorithm based on the minimum average waiting time.

## Description
The program takes the number of processes and their respective arrival times, burst times, and priorities as input from the user. It then applies the four scheduling algorithms to the processes and computes the waiting time and turnaround time for each process under each algorithm. Finally, it compares the average waiting times of the algorithms and outputs the most efficient algorithm.

## Scheduling Algorithms
- 1.) First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):

  - Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive in the ready queue.
  - Non-preemptive scheduling.
- 2.) Shortest Job First (SJF):

  - Processes with the shortest burst time are scheduled first.
  - Non-preemptive scheduling.
- 3.) Round Robin (RR):

  - Each process gets executed for a fixed time quantum in a cyclic order.
  - Preemptive scheduling.
- 4.) Priority Scheduling:

  - Processes are scheduled based on their priority.
  - Non-preemptive scheduling.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To compile and run this program, you need a C++ compiler. If you don't have one installed, you can use GCC, which is commonly available on Unix-like systems.
- 1.) Clone the Repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/GarvJuneja977/CPU-Schedular.git
  cd CPU-Schedular 
- 2.) Compile the Program:
  ```
  g++ main-program.cpp -o main-program
- 3.) Run the Program:
  ```
  ./main-program
- 4.) Input:

  - The program will prompt you to enter the number of processes.
  - For each process, input the arrival time, burst time, and priority.
  - For Round Robin, input the time quantum.
- 5.) Output:

  - The program will display the waiting time and turnaround time for each process under each scheduling algorithm.
  - It will also print the average waiting time for each algorithm.
  - Finally, it will print the most efficient algorithm based on the minimum average waiting time.
